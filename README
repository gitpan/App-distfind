NAME
    App::distfind - Find Perl module distributions within a directory
    hierarchy

VERSION
    version 1.101400

SYNOPSIS
        $ distfind
        path/to/My-Dist path/to/My-Other-Dist

        $ distfind --dir foo --dir bar --prune deprecated --line
        foo/some/path/My-Dist
        foo/some/other/path/My-Other-Dist
        bar/yet/another/path/My-Shiny

        $ distfind --dir baz --print-roots
        baz

        $ distfind --print-path Foo-Bar --prefix "ls -al "
        ls -al path/to/Foo-Bar

    To be able to run programs from within your development directories
    without having to install the distributions, add this to your ".bashrc":

        for i in $(distfind)
        do
            if [ -d $i/bin ]; then
                PATH=$i/bin:$PATH
            fi
        done

DESCRIPTION
    "distfind" can find Perl module distributions in a directory hierarchy.
    A Perl distribution in this sense is defined as a directory that
    contains a "Makefile.PL", "Build.PL" or "dist.ini" file.

FUNCTIONS
  run
    The main function, which is called by the "distfind" program.

  normalize_dirs
    This function takes a reference to an array of directory specifications.
    It then normalizes them by splitting them along colon or semicolon
    characters and filters out duplicates. Tilde characters will be expanded
    to $ENV{HOME}. The returning list is returned as an array reference.

  find_dists
    Traverses the given directories, looks for Perl module distributions,
    and returns a list of paths to those distribution directories. See
    "--prune" for directories that will be pruned. Also if a Perl module
    distribution directory is found, it is then pruned because we assume
    that it won't recursively contain another Perl module distribution.

OPTIONS
    Options can be shortened according to "Case and abbreviations" in
    Getopt::Long.

    "--dir"
        This option takes a string argument and can be given several times.
        Specifies a directory that should be searched for Perl module
        distributions. If no directories are specified, the value of
        $ENV{PROJROOT} is added by default.

    "--prune"
        This option takes a string argument and can be given several times.
        If a directory with this name is encountered, it will be pruned.

        By default, the following directories are pruned: ".svn", ".git",
        "blib" and "skel".

    "--print-roots"
        This option causes the directories that would be searched to be
        printed, without actually searching them. The "--join" option is
        used, if given. See "--dir" on how this could be different from the
        options you gave at the command-line.

    "--print-path"
        This option takes a string argument and can be given several times.
        It has the effect of restricting what will be printed to the given
        distribution names. For example:

            $ distfind --print-path Foo-Bar --print-path Baz

        will only print paths to those distributions:

            path/to/Foo-Bar path/to/Baz

    "--prefix"
        This option takes a string argument. If given, every distribution
        path will be prefixed with this string as it is printed.

    "--suffix"
        This option takes a string argument. If given, every distribution
        path will be suffixed with this string as it is printed.

    "--join"
        This option takes a string argument. When printing distribution
        paths, they will be separated by this string. It defaults to a
        single space character.

    "--line"
        Print each distribution path on a line of its own. It overrides the
        "--join" option.

    "--help"
        Prints a brief help message and exits.

    "--man"
        Prints the manual page and exits.
